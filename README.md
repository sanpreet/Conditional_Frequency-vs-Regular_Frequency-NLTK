### Difference between Conditional-Frequency distribution and Regular Frequency distribution in NLTK
Using Regular Frequency distribtuion you can count words fot single condition whereas counting words for multiple condition is provided by
Conditional Frequency distribution. Please look at the Graphs above and understand what I mean to say here. In the above example using frequency distribtuion each items in the same group (Pens in Group Pen and Pencil in Group Pencil) is counted seperately whereas for the conditional frequency distribution Since three of the pens belongs to pen and two of the pencil belongs to pencil, answer will be provided in 2 lines. 1st Line for Pen categorization and 2nd Line for Pencil Categorization.

### How to run this code
Please see the Conditional_freq_vs_freq_distrbution.ipynb. This is the running file. You can visualize it from there or you can install jupyter notebook and download the file Conditional_freq_vs_freq_distrbution.ipynb in an folder. You can use terminal or command prompt and fetch that path where the file Conditional_freq_vs_freq_distrbution.ipynb is downloaded and run the following command
```
jupyter notebook
```
